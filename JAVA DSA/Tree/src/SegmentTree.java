// Performing query on a range sum,max, avg, min , prod, etc. of number in specific range then we use segment tree as it perform operation in O(logN) time
// for update the complexity is same as O(logN)
// Segment tree is a binary tree which has info about interval and operation we are performing
// It is full binary tree as every node except root node has two children.
